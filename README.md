# ML, DL, and NLP Portfolio

This repository showcases some of my work in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

## Index

- **HF Dataset - SciEntsBank:** Loads the SciEntsBank dataset from its original XML files and converts it into a Hugging Face dataset for NLP tasks.
- **HF Dataset - Beetle:** Loads the Beetle dataset from its original XML files and converts it into a Hugging Face dataset for NLP tasks.
- **RL DDQN - Energy-Constrained Path Planning:** Demonstrates an implementation of Deep Double Q-Learning (DDQN) to solve an energy-constrained path planning problem, where an agent learns to navigate a grid-based environment efficiently, optimizing energy consumption while utilizing charging stations to recharge its battery.
